## Decorative

Render a decorative icon with no semantic meaning. This is useful for icons that are purely decorative and do not convey any information to the user.

<DocsStory of={IconStories.Decorative} />

## Informative

Render an informative icon with semantic meaning. This is useful for icons that convey information to the user, such as a warning or error icon. This will render an `aria-label` attribute to describe the icon to assistive technologies.

<DocsStory of={IconStories.Informative} />
