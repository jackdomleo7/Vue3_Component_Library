<Title>SCSS Modules</Title>

This library comes with a set of SCSS modules that you can `@use` into your project. These do not come bundled as default, they need to be imported manually.


## `_sr-only.scss`

```ts
@use '@jackdomleo7/vue3-library/src/styles/modules/sr-only' as *;
```

This module contains 2 classes that can be used to hide elements visually but keep them accessible to screen readers.

- `.sr-only`: Hides the element visually but keeps it accessible to screen readers.
- `.sr-only--focusable`: Hides the element visually but keeps it accessible to screen readers. It will be visible when focused.

```html
<button class="icon-only"><span class="sr-only">Close</span> &times;</button>

<button class="sr-only--focusable">Skip to main content</button>
```
